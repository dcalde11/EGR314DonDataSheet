My responsibility lies in the Motion and Speed Sensing Module of the vehicle. The module itself is responsible for  detecting the vehicle\u2019s motion state (also known as the zero state), measuring speed, and identifying obstacles to  ensure safe and accurate operation. The table details each requirement along with its description, outlining the  minimum threshold necessary for the module to function correctly. Each component is surface-mounted, aside from minor components such as resistors and capacitors. This module will operate independently using a surface-mounted 3.3V switching power regulator and an ESP32 microcontroller as its processing unit. It will utilize sensors such as  Hall Effect sensors for speed measurement and distance sensors for obstacle detection, while communicating motion  data wirelessly to the system or user interface. The module\u2019s fast reaction time ensures that motion changes are  detected and reported promptly, supporting the overall safe operation and control of the vehicle.</p> Requirement Description Measure of Threshold  (Minimum to Pass) TargetMeasure StretchRequirement(Y-N) Surface mounted, 3.3V switching power regulator Will be used to supply power to the module as it has to work independently as well. 3.2 Volts 3.3 Volts No Surface mounted microcontroller (ESP) Will Serve as the \"Brain\" of the module, ESP ESP32 No Wireless Communication Able to send or receive a Wi-Fi data Being able to send and get some sort of signal Efficiently Send and receive Wi-Fi Data to MQTT Yes Speed Measurement Sensor (Hall Effect Sensor) Measures/estimates the speed of the vehicle in 3D Space +/- 10% accuracy +/- 5% accuracy No Motion Detection (2 Hall Effect Sensor) Detects whether the vehicle is moving, stopped, or changing direction Correct State/ Zero State Is able to update motion accurately No Reaction Time Time required for motion changes to be detected and reported Less than 2 milliseconds Less than 1 millisecond No Distance Sensing (Ultrasonic, or IR Sensor) Detects nearby obstacles to inform motion state Detects objects within 1 ft Detects objects within 2ft with adjustable range No"},{"location":"02-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Module's Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#block-diagram-overview","title":"Block Diagram Overview","text":"<p>This block diagram illustrates the overall system architecture centered around the PIC18F47Q42 microcontroller.
