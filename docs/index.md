## Introduction
As a member of Team 307, my responsibility is to ensure everyone stays on track to meet our project deadlines while
maintaining a professional tone when enforcing quality standards and expectations. This will be accomplished by supporting
my teammates with the development of their modulus within the project. However not being limited to that but, taking it to
the extent of making tough calls on priority tasks, and pushing back deadlines to uphold integrity in ourselves and our
work. While my main subsystem still hasn't been disclosed I look forward to the collaboration this project brings. This
record outlines my contributions to the electrical setup and performance that made the project a success.
